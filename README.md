# The-Pig-Game

### Introduction

This is a project created when I was taking a javascript course. This project was a challenge, based on the pig game.<br><br>
Originally the game of Pig is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points. 
However, in my implementation I kept as 30 the value that the player must reach to win the game.<br>  
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

<strong>roll</strong> - If the player rolls a 
* 1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.<br>
* 2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.<br>

<strong>hold</strong>  - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.<br><br>
